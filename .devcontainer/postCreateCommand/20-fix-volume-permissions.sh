#!/bin/bash
# Verifies and fixes permissions for mounted volumes
#
# Purpose:
#   Ensures the dev container user can access mounted directories for
#   storing credentials and configuration files.
#
# Effects:
#   - Checks write permissions on Docker volume directories
#   - Changes ownership of Docker volumes to current user
#   - Creates directories if they don't exist
#
# Assumptions:
#   - HOME environment variable is set
#   - Current user has sudo access (standard in dev containers)
#   - ~/.claude, ~/.gemini, and ~/.config/gh are Docker named volumes
#
# Design rationale:
#   - Fixes permissions on all Docker-managed volumes
#   - Creates directories if they don't exist
#   - set -e ensures script fails on unexpected errors
