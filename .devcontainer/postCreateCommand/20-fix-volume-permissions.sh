#!/bin/bash
# Verifies and fixes permissions for mounted volumes
#
# Purpose:
#   Ensures the dev container user can access mounted directories for
#   storing credentials and configuration files.
#
# Effects:
#   - Checks write permissions on bind-mounted directories
#   - Changes ownership of Docker volumes (but not bind mounts)
#   - Exits with code 0 even if warnings are present
#
# Assumptions:
#   - HOME environment variable is set
#   - Current user has sudo access (standard in dev containers)
#   - ~/.claude and ~/.gemini are bind mounts from host
#   - ~/.config/gh is a Docker named volume
#
# Design rationale:
#   - Never modifies bind mount permissions (would affect host system)
#   - Only fixes permissions on Docker-managed volumes
#   - Warnings are non-fatal to allow development to continue
#   - set -e ensures script fails on unexpected errors
