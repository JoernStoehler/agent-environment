# Validates OpenTelemetry collector and Honeycomb configuration
#
# Purpose:
#   Ensures telemetry infrastructure is properly configured for development.
#   Fails fast with actionable error messages if setup is incomplete.
#
# Effects:
#   - Sources .env file to check environment variables
#   - Queries Docker to verify OTEL collector is running
#   - Exits with code 1 if critical components are missing
#
# Assumptions:
#   - Docker socket is mounted (standard for dev containers)
#   - OTEL collector service is managed by docker-compose
#   - .env file contains HONEYCOMB_API_KEY and HONEYCOMB_DATASET
#
# Design rationale:
#   - Waits up to 10 seconds for OTEL collector to allow for slow startups
#   - Provides copy-paste commands for fixing common issues
#   - Non-zero exit prevents downstream scripts from running with broken telemetry
